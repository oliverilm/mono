It is designed for helping the OpenAPI\n * generator libraries, which converts {@link OpenApi.IOperation OpenAPI operations} to\n * an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) function.\n *\n * The key feature of the `HttpModule` is the {@link HttpMigration.application} function.\n * It converts the {@link OpenApi.IOperation OpenAPI operations} to the\n * {@link IHttpMigrateRoute HTTP migration route}, and it normalizes the OpenAPI operations\n * to the RPC function calling suitable route structure.\n *\n * The other functions, {@link HttpMigration.execute} and {@link HttpMigration.propagate},\n * are for executing the HTTP request to the HTTP server. The {@link HttpMigration.execute}\n * function returns the response body from the API endpoint when the status code is `200`\n * or `201`. Otherwise, it throws an {@link HttpError} when the status code is not `200`\n * or `201`. The {@link HttpMigration.propagate} function returns the response information\n * from the API endpoint, including the status code, headers, and response body.\n *\n * The {@link HttpLlm} module is a good example utilizing this `HttpMigration` module\n * for composing RPC function calling application. The {@link HttpLlm} module composes\n * LLM (Large Language Model) function calling application from the OpenAPI document\n * bypassing through the {@link IHttpLlmApplication} type.\n *\n * @author Jeongho Nam - https://github.com/samchon\n */\nexport namespace HttpMigration {\n  /* -----------------------------------------------------------\n    COMPOSER\n  ----------------------------------------------------------- */\n  /**\n   * Convert HTTP migration application from OpenAPI document.\n   *\n   * `HttpMigration.application()` is a function converting the\n   * {@link OpenApi.IDocument OpenAPI document} and its {@link OpenApi.IOperation operations}\n   * to the {@link IHttpMigrateApplication HTTP migration application}.\n   *\n   * The HTTP migration application is designed for helping the OpenAPI generator\n   * libraries, which converts OpenAPI operations to an RPC (Remote Procedure Call)\n   * function.
